###Number 3:
$Z_t$~WN($\mu=0, \sigma^2=1$)

$Y_t = Z_t^2$

#####Part A: Using R generate 300 observations of the Gaussian white noise Z. Plot the series and its acf

```{r}
#Simulate Gaussian WN 
z <- rnorm(300, 0, 1)

#Plot ACF
acf(z)

#Plot Series
plot(z, type = 'l')
```

#####Part B:  Using R, plot 300 observations of the series Y = $Z_t^2$. Plot its acf.

```{r}
#Plot ACF
y=z^2
acf(y)

#Plot Series
plot(y, type = "l")
```

#####Part C: Analyze graphs from (a) and (b)

The plot of z bands around zero line with approximatly good behavior; it contains positive and negative values. The y plot is completely positive, with some datapoints that seem like strong outliers. There is strong evidence to suggest stationary in z plot, but not in y plot.

#####Part D: Calculate the second-order moments of Y, Expection, Variance, and Auto-Correlation. Do your calculations support your observations in (c)?

The acf function of y resembles gaussian white noise although it doesn't present enough evidence to conclude.

```{r}
mean(y)
var(y)
acf(y)
```

###Number 4: Find their roots, show calculations. Check your answers using R command polyroot:

```{r}
polyroot(c(1, -2))
polyroot(c(1, -0.45, 0.05))
```
